- ## Representing Graphs
	- Graphs can be drawn, however is not suitable for computer representation
		- ((63c6858d-8d81-4ef4-8d4d-6ea3a1eb638c))
	- Adjacency-list, used for sparse graphs, when |E| is much less than |V|^2
		- ((63c68578-b54d-4907-b16f-be069a171764))
	- Adjacency-matrix, for dense graphs, when |E| is close to |V|^2
		- ((63c6854d-4d68-43c2-a36d-70d37fe18859))

- ## Breadth First Search
	- Computes the distance from a source vertex to every other vertex
	-
	- ((63c7d5f8-2038-4409-b6e9-bbfc75baf5c1))
- ## Depth First Search
	- Always searches as deep as possible into the graph
	- Visits a non-visited neighbouring node until it reaches a node with no neighbours that can be visited.
		- Recursive DFS ((63c7dbeb-a0da-4d7b-bd79-d3b63ef30552))

	- ### Forest
		- Traversing a DFS builds up a ((63c7dcbf-285e-45fb-8cc2-9bc71af4ee1b))
		- ((63c7dcf8-a0e4-4878-b3f8-a2d94620919b))
		- First created is created by starting at 0
		- Once all accessible nodes are reached from 0, checks whether more remain
		- Second tree is then created
		- Many trees create a forest
- ## Topological Sorting
	- ((63c7e82d-e825-4c9c-b992-5f6c4e24c978))
	- A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph without cycles
	- A directed graph has a topological order if and only if it is a DAG
	- LATER Finish Topological
- ## Dijkstra
	- Find the shortest path between 2 nodes
	- Is usually used on a weighted graph
	- Is a type of greedy algorithm
	- O(m+n)lg(n) - where n =nº verteces, m =nº of edges
	- ((63c7efbc-0438-4a31-96de-1fc2f69acd53))
