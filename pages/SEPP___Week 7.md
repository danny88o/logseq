- # Verification Validation and Testing
	- What is a bug?
		- Mistake: An action that produces a fault
		- Fault: An incorrect step, process or data definition
		- Error: Difference between a computed value and the corrrect one
		- Failure: Software or whole system failing to deliver an entire service
-
- ## Aproaches to testing:
	- ### Black box:
		- Act as if there is no knowledge of the internal structure
		- Tests dont need to be changed, "higher level test"
		- May not throughly exercise the different ways/path code is executed
	- ### White Box
		- Considers the internal structure
		- Helps developers check their work
		- If requirements are misinterpreted, refactoring will require updates
	- ### Regression testing
		- Repeat all tests
- ## Kinds of test
- ((6409efb7-a3de-425c-a255-bdde712dffcf))
- ## How to test
	- Tests should be:
		- Repetable (no random factors)
		- Documented
		- Precise
		- Done on controlled software
- ## Test-first development
	- Write tests as informed by and encapsulating requirements
	- Run tests as code is written
	- Also clarifies requirements
	- Avoids poor ambiguity resolution - no cutting corners
	- Time for test writing built in at it's core
- ## Test-driven development
	- Like test-driven, but tests $\textbf{completely replaces}$ requirements
- ## Behaviour driven
	- More interpretable to stakeholder than normal tests
	- Still not completely interpretable, may loose sight of higher level needs

- # Testing in practice
- ## Testing automation with JUnit
	- _Used for use cases_
	- uses in a test class $$@test$$
	- makes use of ((6410837c-acbb-48ab-8653-3c62c334a39d)) methods, usually only one per tests
	- You can use annotations
		- Add name
		- Disable test
		- Add tag and then run only certain tags
	- Other ((641081e6-04c5-49f0-827e-8b5cae966bad)) to prepare and clean envitoment
- ## Inline assertions
	- _Used for sanity checks_
	- Usually at start or end of a function
	- Can be switched on and off! Very Cool!
		- Remember to do it though, can be very unprofessional if error appears in production
	- ### Alternatives
		- ((641084c6-534a-4a2d-8b57-d0b370ba7ab7))
			- Carries faults across
			- Mejor prevenir faults que curar faults
			- Better to have input validations class
		- ((6410850f-d3d2-46fb-b3da-609218bd8a45))
			- Program fails gracefully
			- Useful to catch faults
- ## Test Coverge
	- ((641086b4-19fc-4afa-b5ee-18297b19189e))
	- ### Statement Coverage
	  $$\frac{\text{Lines of code executed by at least one test}}{\text{Lines of code}}$$
	- ### Branch Coverage
	  $$\frac{\text{Nº of branches executed by test}} {\text{Nº of branches}}$$
	-
	- $$\text{100\%  branch coverage} \implies \text{100\% statement coverage}$$
		- ### IntelliJ coverage tools
