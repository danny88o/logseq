- # What OS?
	- The first thing that runs
	- Manages the computers hardware
	- SO the intermediary
	- BIG program - ((65a64c50-bdb1-4e2a-a981-fbc59e124792))
	-
	- ## Goals of an OS
		- The intermediary allows for abstraction of hardware
		- Write once run everywhere with same OS and ISA
		- Efficient use  of hardware
		- Isolation Security and Protection
		- Reliability
-
- # Why OS?
	- Simplicity - see files instead of device registers
	- Portability
	- Safety - every program only "sees" its own virtual machine
	- Efficiency
-
- ## Hardware Recap
- ### Devices
	- Every one has a device controller that
		- Moves data
		- Runs in parallel  to cpu
		- Has buffers
	- Reading file on disk

- # When OS?
	- 60 year long evolutionary process
	- ## Evolution
		- ((65a8ed7e-f3a6-4d78-973c-6f7d307f5e95))
		- ### Asynchronous I/O
			- One, Program at the time, one user at the time
		- ### Multiprogram
			- TODO
		- ### Timesharing
			- TODO
		- ### Parallel Systems
			- TODO
