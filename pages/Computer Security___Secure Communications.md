- ## Establishing Public Keys
	- ### The Problem:
		- How to establish public keys
		- i.e. how to establish a key between identity (domain) and public key
	- ### Potential Solutions
		- Public announcements - *Broadcast public key*
			- Does not solve authentication problem
			- Anyone could boradcast
		- Publicly available directories - *Publish their public key on public directories*
			- Same issue
			- Anyone can claim they are some identity
		- Public-key authorities - *Have someone we already trust*
			- Have to contact authority for every public key need
		- Public key certificates -
			- As reliable as pc-authorities
			- Removes bottleneck problem
- ## Public Key Certificates
	- ### X.509
		- Standard Framework
		- ((6535a1ba-ea22-418e-ad22-f0ab229ac3c7))
	- ### Chain of Trust
	  *The power of friendship*
		- Having one CA signing all certs not practical
		- Root Cert $\implies$ Level 1 Cert $\implies$ Level 2 cert
		- This provides the necessary structure for all cert signing
	- ### Self-Signed Certs
		- UoE used be its own certifying authority
		- Issued by the server you are attempting to connect to
		- Not in root or in chain to root
		- Very-rare nowadays
