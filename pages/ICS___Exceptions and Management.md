- Intentional exceptions
	- Request certain OS functions, ex:
		- I/O
		- Memory
	- In MIPS
		- Register $v0 is set to type of syscall wanted
		- Parameters are passed through $a0, $a1...
		- syscall then called

- Handling exceptions in MIPS
	- Steps:
		- Store the address of current instruction in the (EPC) ((63a230ff-90d2-4221-a745-c420b83e874b))
		- Transfer control to OS (address known), which starts kernel mode
		- Preserve registers
		- Handle exception
		- return to program using ((63a236b3-76de-4af0-a7b3-bf5d241ce438)), and returns to user mode
		-
	- OS has to know nature of exception to handle it:
		- MIPS uses a status register (Cause) to record it
			- If restartable, take corrective action
			- else terminate and report error using EPC and Cause
		- Alternatively vectored interrupts ((63a23089-3d26-4812-a16d-3802ede7ad22))
-
- Why is it so involved?
	- OS has to guarantee safe access to system resources
	- The supreme arbiter
		- TLB miss, acceptable, access page table to service
		- Overflow, may be okay
		- Illegal opcode, must be killed ruthlessly and without mercy
- ((63a23a77-aba0-4ff6-8f5c-4fe426461719))
	- Guarantees that control is by OS during "Dangerous tasks"
	- OS stops programs from:
		- interfering with each other
		- access to resources they do not have permission too
	- Time sharing of CPU
		- Multiplex the CPU and memory among several user processes
		- Switch frome one process to another when:
			- it performs I/O
			- its time slice expires
