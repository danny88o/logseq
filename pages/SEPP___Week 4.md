	- A is better because it is safer, user does not have the same access as straight inheritance
- # Design Principles
- ### Cohesion
	- The measure of strength of the relationship between pieces of functionality
	- You want high cohesion
	- Benefits: Understandability, Maintainability and Realiability
- ### Coupling
	- The measure of the strength of the inter-connections between components
	- Loose coupling is desired
	- Benefits: Increased understandability, flexibility and _maintainability_
- ### Abstraction
	- Focuses on the info relevant to its purpose, no more, no less - doesnt _need_ info
	- Abstraction is desirable
	- Benefits: Implementation does not affect the outcome
- ### Encapsulation
	- Grouping of internal detail of abstraction and making inaccessible -  _can't_ access info
	- Encapsulation is desirable
- ### Separation of interface and implementation
	- Combines Abstraction and Encapsulation
- ### Modularisation
	- Divide large system into smaller components

- # Class Diagrams
- ## Identify Classes from a Description
	- ((63e2642d-27d7-4831-a193-3d3c0785aa07))
	- Eliminate: library, short term loan, member of the library, week, time
	- Left with: item, book, journal, copy (of book), library member, member of staff.
- ## Association between classes
	- Object is an instance of a class
	- Link is an instance of an association
	- Types of association
		- Object class A sends message to class B
		- Object A creates an object B
		- Object A has an atribute whose values are objects of class B
		- Object A receives a message with object B as an argument
	- Showing association
		- ((63e26699-1b07-44f9-9bd2-624c35e53ab5))
		- Should be read as "_PersonalTutor_ has 1 to 30 _tutees_, _tutees are students_"
		- The ((63e2672f-a99a-4bb2-9017-7493244e93cb)) and ((63e26736-bb91-40b8-a47b-561590fac6bd)) are optional, they are there to make things clearer
		- ((63e26781-658a-4a91-9eba-a5d93e4a1686))
		  Course can access student
	- Alternative showing of association
		- ((63e26821-be02-48b3-85dd-60512be7001c))
		- Only used for case 3 of object assoc
		- Use one or the other
