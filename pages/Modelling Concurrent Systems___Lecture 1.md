# Specification vs Implementation
	- Mathematical models for *Formal Specification* and *Abstract Implementations*
	- Verification for bi-implication

	- Weekly homework, formative feedback no mark
	- Choose some to be marked and graded

- ## Relay Concurrent System Example
	- Runner 1: $Starts \implies Runs \implies Gives Batton$
	- $RUNNER_1 := start \cdot give$
	- $RUNNER_2:= receive \cdot finish$
	- Sequential composition: $RUNNER_1 || RUNNER_2$
	- Act = $\{start, give, recieve, finish\}$
		- However this composition would imply that receive, finish start give could occur.
	- So create a partial function: $(\gamma(recv,give) = handover)$
		- Act = $\{start, give, receive, finish, handover\}$
		- But you can still do impossible action sequences
	- $\delta_H(RUNNER_1 || RUNNER_2)$       $H=\{give,recv\}$  This delets actions give and recv
	- Now only possible path is $start \cdot handover \cdot finish$
		- However SPEC = $start\cdot finish$
	- Branching Bisimulation
		- $\tau_I(\delta_H(RUNNER_1 || RUNNER_2)$)  $I = \{handover\}$
	- # I genuinely found this really fun
