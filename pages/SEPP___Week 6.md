- # Construction
- ## High Quality Code
	- Does what its meant to
	- Persists after changes
	- On large projects, other people will have to read, understand and access:
		- Staff movement
		- Code reviews
		- Debugging
		- Maintenance
		- Yourself! (Much later on)
	- ### How to (formatting):
		- ((63fe0fc1-4d29-493c-8a1b-db0a154d708c))
			- Usually companies have a style you should follow
			- Whatever the case always be consistent in its use
		- ((63fe102e-ace7-4571-b887-9e3f3790aeb6))
			- Use correct indentation... duh
			- Some editors use different number of spaces for a tab, so adhere to a convention
		- ((63fe10f2-090f-4480-b073-d24ee4be28a5))
			- Use Meaningful names
				- Sometimes comments will go out of sinc, dont patch bad names with comment
			- Some conventions exist for short names "numpy" as "np" or "i" for loop
		- ((63fe124e-4684-4f27-8bc2-ed4ba7ba3535))
			- Don't State the obvious
			- Talk about assumptions made
			- Sometimes too _many_ comment is more serious then too few
			- Clarity of code and good naming should cover a lot of the explanation, over-explaining can cause problems
			- ((63fe1374-fa5e-452a-82e7-dacb80887a66)) lol
	- ### How to (code):
		- Variables
			- Keep local variable scope restricted, declare variable where it is used
		- Loops:
			- Use appropriately
			- If statements should put most frequent first
			- Avoid deep nesting
		- Methods
			- Should each do 1 thing
			- Short (<200 lines)
		- Defensive programming
			- Checking assumptions
			- Use assertions and error handling
		- Balance structural complexity vs code duplication
		- Remove dead code
		- Balance complexity vs maintainability vs usability
	- ### JavaDoc

- # Version Control
- A system is ever evolving
- Multiple versions might have to be maintained
- ## Software Configuration Management!
	- ((6400b51d-52df-467e-be4b-25f9e16e3409))
	- ### Version Control
		- Keep Copies of versions
		- Track changes
		- Manage situations where mutiple edits want to be made
	- ### Lock-Modify-Unlock Model
		- ((6400b749-f003-42c2-a9e8-e0178e38ec08))
		- ((6400b7ba-9c0f-417b-b1eb-219dec90e35a)) exists, it shouldn't
	- ### CVS and SVN
		- Still one main
		- Uses ((6400b826-677c-4e12-8eff-b9dc52d380a2)) model
		- Commits to changed file might cause merge conflicts, which will be manually solved
	- ### Distributed Version Control
		- What GitHub uses
		- Very fast VC operations
		- Works (for a while) offline
		- Can become chaotic if protocols aren't applied properly
		-
