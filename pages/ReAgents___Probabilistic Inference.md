		  To make this true, there is an almost unlimited set of problems
		- Cavity \Rightarrow Toothache
		  Is also incorrect, not all cavities cause pain
	- Trying to use a logic to describe domains with uncertainty therefore fails because:
		- Laziness: Too much work!
		- Theoretical Ignorance: No complete theory of domain
		- Practical Ignorance: It may be hard/impossible to run all necessary tests
	- Instead provide a ((64552531-b3c1-49f6-8529-05f2ab0187ac))
