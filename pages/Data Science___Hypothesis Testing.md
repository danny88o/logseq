- ## Hypothesis Testing
	- ((63c523c7-6b09-4ce7-96db-b70675cc2a29))
	- Ho and not(Ho)
	- Rejecting Ho tells us little about the alternative, not-rejecting Ho does not mean Ho is true, another distribution might be better/fit more accurately

- ## p-values
	- ((63c5271b-10be-48b2-9f87-379c6c0f2d8f))
- ## Chi-Squared
	- When there is multiple categories this is used
	- ((63c7c9b4-713d-4f4e-9602-90cca45eacb9))
	- ((63c7c9d0-9a20-42d9-b703-965401c22f31))
	- ((63c7c9e0-8559-4920-8ec6-4c7a3458215f))
	- 357 as a chi value is statistically impossible, p lim o
	- If it had been close to 0, it could mean a quota was trying to be reached
