- # Classical Planning
- ## PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)
	- Expresses **factored representation** ((63fde340-36f8-424a-9c53-382937cd6bc0))
	- Each state is represented as a conjunction of ground, functionless atoms
	- A package truck delivery problem might be $$At(Truck_1,Melbourne)\land At(Truck_2,Sydney)$$
	- ((63fde733-fdd1-45a3-8406-16cee8fdfb4d)) -- Interesting example!
	- ### Contains:
		- States - Conjunction of propsoitionals or positive literals
		- Goal - Partial description of a state
		- Action:
			- Precondition -  States in which and action is executable
			- Effect - How the literals in the input state get changed
-
- ## Partial Order Planning
	- - Preprocessing
	- Actions - initial plan contains dummy actions Start and Finish
		- Start sets initial state
		- Finish has the goal state as a precondition
	- - Plan
	- Ordering constraints
		- A must occur before B
	- Casul links
		- The effect of A must not alter the precondition for B
	-
- ## Real World Panning
	- The state is never fully codeable
