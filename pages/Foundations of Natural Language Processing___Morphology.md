- # Morphology
	- *Words are not the smallest unit of language!*
	- ## Linguistic Intro
		- English has an impoverished morphology
		- Other languages are agglunative
		- ### English Morphology
			- Stems:
				- The dictionary bit
			- Affixes:
				- Prefix | Suffix | Infix | Circumfix
			- Combine them:
				- Inflection = stem + affix
				  e.g. walk -> walking
				- Derivation = stem + affix \pm grammar change
				  e.g. combine -> combination
				- Compounding = \sum stem
				  e.g. doghouse
				- Cliticization
				  e.g. I've
		- ### TODO productive rule/compounding?? very cool
		- ### Different Inflection in different languages
			- Avrupallatramadklarmzdanmsnzcasna =as if you are reportedly of those of ours that we were unable to Europeanize
			  wtf
	- ## Morphological Parsing
		- ### Why Bother
			- Search engines: fox should return stuff with foxes
			- Spell checking: sleeped -> slept
			- Exhaustive word list is not accurat
	- ## Finite State Transducers (FST)
		- ### Parsing
			- e.g. foxes
			- Surface form = foxes
			- Intermediate form = fox^s
			- Lexical form = fox +N +PL
		- ### Nondeterministic Finite State Automatons (NFAs)
		- ### FST
			-
	- ## Using FST
