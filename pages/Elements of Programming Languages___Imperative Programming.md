- # Imperative Programming
	- ## Mutability
		- ### Immutability
			- Referential Transparency
			- Easier to reason and optimizr
			- Types "mean" more
	- ## While-programs
		- ### Statements
			- ((6548f595-d0d5-4164-9c15-030c7981762b))
			- *skip* does nothing
			- Use {} to parenthesize statements
		- ### Factorial Example
			- ((6548f623-a04d-442e-87e8-2e3a0ff00f25))
			- ((6548f642-c133-4098-8b93-f7bc78f5979d))
	- ### $L_{While}$
		- ((6548fb46-b5f6-41bd-9a4f-a1d1cc715c5c))
	- ## Other Control flow Structures
		- ### for
			- ((6548fa1d-76da-4947-8ba9-10a3dbc06e1a))
			- forEach loop is very similar
		- ### Procedures
			- Currently unrealistic, no functions!
			- Later will combine $L_{While}$ and $L_{Rec}$
	- ## Unstructured Control (non-examinable)
	  background-color:: red
		- ### *goto* Considered Harmful
			- Dijkstra listed many disadvantages of GoTo in a letter to CACM
			- Control flow is very difficult to decipher
			- Labels could be in different scope/procedure
		- ### *goto* Caveats
			- In most modern languages, safe to use but only if very good reason
				- High performance code
				- Jump out of a nested loop e.g if 0 is multiplying leave
			- Safe use within same procedure/scope
		- ### *goto* fail
			- ((6548fdb0-a9d1-4e4b-a2cb-1cb7776b6213))
			- Apple SSL was compromised!
		- ### *switch* statements

- # Small-step Evaluation
	- ## Semantics
		- e -> e'
		- If e_{0} -> ... -> e_{n} it can be written as:
		   e_{0} ->* e_{n}
		- ((65522ff1-2c0c-471b-82da-90c8447bba0b))
		- ### L_{Arith} 
		  ((6552306a-8321-446f-86a0-52eb6aa1fa87))
		- ### L_{if}
		  ((655230de-41d0-4d80-9290-d96fa91bc7ef))
		- L_{Let}
		  ((65523185-9f3c-484d-af69-f1ada7a0b84c))
	- ## Judgments
		- *A relation among one or more abstract syntax trees*
		- ### Rule Meanings
			- Axiom: 
			  $$\frac{ }{Q}$$
			- Conditional Judgment:
			  $$\frac{P_1 \; ... \; P_n }{Q}$$
		- ### Rule Induction
			- ((655235f9-bc6c-4148-a32d-9c28d5cfa2fe))
	- ## Type Soundness
		- ### Value Soundness
		  If $⊢e : τ$ and  $e →* v$ then  $⊢ v : τ .$

- # References, Arrays, and Resources
	- ## References
		- TODO Was complicated had to pay attention
-
- # Evaluation Strategies and Laziness
	- Some aspects of small-step evaluation seem arbitrary
	- e.g. Left -> Rigth vs Right -> Left evaluation order
	- ## Call by Value (eager/strict evaluation)
		- Evaluates argument *then* binds to variables
		- Is the default in most languages
		- ### Advantages
			- Evaluates everey $e$ at most once
			- Predicatable Performance
			- Predictable Side-effects
		- ### Disadvanteges
			- Might evaluate values that are not needed
	- ## Call by Name
		- Substitute expression *then* evaluate
		- Removes unnecessary evaluations
		- Example:
		  ((655b6bec-65e0-4d44-a454-d0d33ac149ec))
		- However argument is computed twice!
		- Might not be as intuative
		- ### CbN Scla
			- Write => infront of type
			- ((655b6d38-23df-406a-a4b8-9d284cb524c1))
		- ### Simulating CbN
			- TODO
		- ### Advantages
			- Can be fast if $e$ not needed
			- Can avoid infinite loops
			- Performance hard to claclulate, requires deep analysis
			- Side effects unpredictable
	- ## Call by Need (Lazy evaluation)
		- Evaluate expression when needed *then* save the result
		- Uses memoization
		- Rules:
		  ((655b72b0-156c-4b37-b8a9-624939a9fa26))
		- ### Pure functional programming:
			- Adopt lazy evaluation, forbid any side-effects
			- Easier to optimize/parallelize so can be faster
			- memoization has overhead
			- I/O, exception is difficult
- # Exception and Control Abstractions
	- ## Exceptions
		- ### try-catch
			- If an exception is raised, transfer control to the corresponding handler
		- ### finally
			- Runs regardless of what is thrown
		- ### throws
			- Unhandled exceptions are thrown
			- THese exceptions need to be declared, if not a typing error occurs
			-
	- ## Tail Recursion
		- Function is a *tail call* if it is the last action of the calling function
		- If every function call is a *tail calll* in a recursive function its is *tail recursive*
	- ## Continuations [non-examinable]
