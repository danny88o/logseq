	- (a) Suppose a random sample of n = 100 bills is drawn at random. 
	  If X is the sample mean, what type of distribution to you expect the sampling distribution of X to be? 
	  normal-distribution, due to central limit theorem
	- (b) Where is the mode of the sampling distribution of X ?
	  9%
	- (c) What is the standard error in the mean?
	  0.6 $std$
	- What is the approximate probability that the sample mean tip is greater than 8%?
	  95%

	- (a) Would a 90% confidence interval calculated from this sample have been narrower
	  or wider than the given interval? Explain your reasoning.
	  Narrower
	- (b) Consider the following statement: There is a 95% chance that $μ$ is between 7.8 and
	  9.4. Is that statement correct? Why or why not?
	  No, there is a 95% chance that the confidence interval contains  $μ$
	- (c) Consider the following statement: We can be highly confident that 95% of all
	  bottles of this type of cough syrup have an alcohol content that is between 7.8 and
	  9.4. Is this statement correct? Why or why not?
	- (d) Consider the following statement: If the process of selecting a sample of size 50
	  and then computing the corresponding 95% interval is repeated 100 times, exactly
	  95 of the resulting intervals will include μ. Is this statement correct? Why or why
	  not?
	  It would be expected, but not necessarily true
	- (e) In order to make the 95% confidence interval three times narrower, how many
	  samples would we need to collect?
	  150
