- ## Software Requirements Basics
	- ((63cfe81c-2f99-45d2-bd65-61d0a43ef6b7))
	- Requirements engineering is used to systematicly handle requirements
	-
	- Requirement types:
		- Functional - Input output style
		- Non-functional(ilities) - Efficiency, Reliability, Usability, Security
	- Non-func are usually more important
		- Func and non-func requirements sometimes will contradict, func may need to be sacrificed
		- User experience is based on non-func
	- E.g.
		- (Non-Functional) The system shall protect the personal information of its users.
		- (Functional) The system shall use two factor authentication.
	-
	- Requirements are usually high-level, **what** is desired not **how**

- ## Stakeholders in requirements

- # Requirement Engineering
- ((63d045a1-35ca-415c-b3e3-7773797b1b2c))
- The major source of project failure according to the CHAOS reports
- ## Requirement Elicitation
	- ### Interviews
		- Ask what they want/what they currently do
		- Jargon specific to that industry can be confusing
		- The interviewed can omit things that to them are obvious
		- Try to enter with an open mind
		- Prepare starting/leading questions
	- ### Scenarios
		- Go over possible interactions with the system
		- What if ...?
		- Can be captured as use cases
	- ### Prototypes
		- Provides high quality feedback
		- Often resolves ambiguitie
	- ### Facilitated Meetings
		- Get Discussion with multiple stakeholders
		- Helps with the intersection of activities, easier to see the bigger picture
		- Helps resolve conflicting requirement ideas
		- Trained facilitator is needed, stuff like people being able to speak to bosses plainly
	- ### Observation
		- Suitable if replacing existing system or business process
		- Allows nuance/subtle tasks to be seen
		- Can be expensive
		- Not very good for innovation
- ## Post-Requirement Elicitation
	- May contain conflicts
	- May be too large
	- ### Specification
		- Informal e.g. handwritten
		- Carefully structured
			- shall for an essential feature or one that will definitely be implemented
			- should for a desirable
			- At launch, everything should be shall
		- Use models with supporting text
		- Latex
	- ### Checks
		- Consistent, Complete
		- Realistic, time+money
		- Verifiability, possible to test
			- e.g. Response time under X
-
- ## Use Cases
	- ((63d28b0a-a639-4802-813b-9af88b88a86d))
	- User is any external system (not just human) that interacts with the system
	-
	- ### Actors
		- Users who take an active part in the use case
		- The have some role, customer not 'Mary'
		- Types:
			- Primary - Triggers the use case
			- Supporting - Also involved
		- Not all stakeholders are actors
		- This provides a way to view everything as an object in OOP
	- ### Scenarios
		- Use cases are a set of scenarios
		- ((63d29009-5fd6-43f7-8c06-be6da207d549))
	- ### Limitations of use cases
		- May needlessly constrain design
		- Include supporting actors that are not essential
		- May miss requirements
-
- # Plan-Driven development Processes vs Agile
	- ((63d3ddc5-6e70-4f07-bcaf-bbe53c92dd6d))
		-
	- ((63d3de10-9ac2-4562-929b-93d9006ccfc1))
		- Happening at the same time with design and implementation
		- Only some requirements during each iteration
		- Requirements are the minimum viability
- ## Software Projects
	- Usually provided as a contract, a plan driven production makes sense to keep requirements in check
	- If contract doesnt have requirements, or customers paying for time not functionality use agile
- ## Software Products
	- 1. Attract customers
	  2. Need to beat competition
	  3. Speedy delivery to the market of the essence
	  4. Reactivity to changes (needs, competitors with new features)
	  5. Few products have innovated without customer input; Fewer have then kept their customers.
	- Agile is good for 1-4
- ## Personnas
	- ((63d3e261-bc59-42b1-b81f-ac961affbf3d))
	- Helps explain why the system will be useful
