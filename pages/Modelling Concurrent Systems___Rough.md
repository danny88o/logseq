- # ODD
	- ## Overview
		- ### Purpose
			- *A guide to the construction of the model*
			- Statement of Problem addressed
			- Specific!
		-
		- ### Patterns
			- What we are modelling
			- Patterns module shoud reproduce
			- ... and not reproduce
		- ### Entities
			- Agents
			- Local
				- e.g. Forest mushrooms
			- Global
				- e.g. Temperature
			- State variables
		- ### Scales
			- Temporal
				- Total length of time $T$
				- Time step of time $t_s = \alpha T$
					- Shortest period in which we might see some change
		- ### Process Overview
			- What entities are doing
			- What interactions can occur and how does this affect that environment
		- ### Scheduling
			- Which model entities
			- Execute with processes
	- ## Design Concepts
		- Coming Soon!
	- ## Details
		- ### Initialisations
			- Values of state variables
		- ### Input data
